# pip install BeautifulSoup4
# pip install request
#
# what is parser ?
# Along with BeautifulSoup we need to install a parser to parse our HTML. Most of the time we can use any parser as long as we are dealing with good HTML. Here we will be using lxml parser.
#
# what is a module?
#  Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.
#
#  import requests
#
#  def get_page_url(url):
#      response = requests.get(url)
#      print(response)
#
# so in above code if the url is right you get response.ok as True
# and response.status_code as 200

## below is an example code to get a hang of the functionality

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import csv

source = requests.get('http://coreyms.com').text

soup = BeautifulSoup(source, 'lxml')

csv_file = open('cms_scrape.csv', 'w')

csv_writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
csv_writer.writerow(['headline', 'summary', 'video_link'])

for article in soup.find_all('article'):
  headline = article.h2.a.text
  print(headline)

    summary = article.find('div', class_='entry-content').p.text
  print(summary)

  try:
      vid_src = article.find('iframe', class_='youtube-player')['src']

      vid_id = vid_src.split('/')[4]
      vid_id = vid_id.split('?')[0]

      yt_link = f'https://youtube.com/watch?v={vid_id}'
  except Exception as e:
      yt_link = None

  print(yt_link)

  print()

  csv_writer.writerow([headline, summary, yt_link])

csv_file.close()
